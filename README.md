* General Information
 Overview Telecom Industry is a very competitive market, exit barriers for customer are low. Loyalty depends on user experince and attractive offers. Industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition. Retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal.

 Problem Statement To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

 The goal is to build a predictive model that can predict the chrun propensity for a customer accurately.
 Identify key features that indicates the customer behaviour to churn

 Approach

STEP 1 : Data Understanding, Preparation, and Pre-Processing : Data understanding, identification of potentially useful and non-useful attributes and variable importance and impact estimation Data preparation, performing data cleaning, missing values imputation, outlier removal, and column level standardization (for e.g., date, etc.) into one format

STEP 2 : Exploratory Data Analysis : Performing basic preliminary data analysis including finding the correlation between variables and scatter plots to identify relationships between variables Performing advanced data analysis, including plotting relevant heatmaps, histograms, and basic clustering to find patterns in the data

STEP 3 : Feature Engineering and Variable Transformation : Feature engineering and performing one or more methods on attributes that can lead to the creation of a new potentially useful variable; for e.g., day from the date Variable transformation and applying categorical variable transformations to turn into numerical data and numerical variable transformations to scale data

STEP 4 : Model Selection, Model Building, and Prediction : Identifying the type of problem and making a list of decisive models from all available choices Choosing a training mechanism; for e.g., cross-validation, etc., and tuning hyperparameters of each model Testing each model on the respective model evaluation metric Choosing the best model based on the fit of the data set and output variable Using ensemble options to improve the efficacy based on the evaluation metric stated in the problem

STEP 5 : Business Recommendation

## Conclusions
Our primary aim is to reduce customer churn, so it becomes utmost important to identify potential churning customers
Given this scenario, the most important metric will be SENSITIVITY
Logistic Regression with feature selection using Random Forest and RFE becomes the best model from business perspective
